# NM-PHASE-2-STOCK-MARKET-PREDICTION
This project leverages artificial intelligence and time series analysis to predict stock prices, aiming to decode market patterns and assist in strategic investment decisions. By utilizing machine learning models and financial data, it delivers insights and predictions that could help investors and analysts better understand market dynamics.

📊 Project Overview
Stock market prediction is a challenging task due to its volatile and non-linear nature. This project combines AI techniques—particularly deep learning—with traditional time series analysis to forecast future stock prices based on historical data.

🚀 Features
Historical stock data collection from reliable sources (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage).

Data preprocessing and visualization.

Time series forecasting using models like:

ARIMA / SARIMA

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

Facebook Prophet

Model evaluation using RMSE, MAPE, and other metrics.

Interactive dashboard to visualize predictions and model performance.

🧠 Technologies Used
Python 3.10+

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

TensorFlow / Keras

statsmodels

yfinance / Alpha Vantage API

Streamlit or Flask (for web dashboard)

Prophet (by Meta for time series forecasting)
📈 How It Works
Fetch historical stock data (default: last 5 years).

Preprocess data (handle missing values, normalize, create lag features).

Train time series models (e.g., LSTM for deep learning, ARIMA for statistical modeling).

Evaluate performance on test data.

Predict future prices and visualize them through plots or a dashboard.

📊 Sample Results
Visual examples of predicted vs actual prices, residual plots, and model metrics can be added here.

📌 Future Improvements
Integrate sentiment analysis from financial news and social media.

Use reinforcement learning for decision-making.

Add cryptocurrency and multi-stock prediction support.

Deploy full-featured web dashboard for live predictions.
